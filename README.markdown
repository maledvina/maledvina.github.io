# Portfolio splash idea

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/maledvina/pen/qBPEEBp](https://codepen.io/maledvina/pen/qBPEEBp).

The idea is that either side of the screen corresponds to my personal/work-related halves. Clicking either half is supposed to move the center-line to the other side, making room for content and navigation. Still playing around with the colors, and the position is a tricky one in particular.
